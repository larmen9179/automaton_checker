# automaton_checker

This repository will be used to simulate finite automaton. 

The user will be able to enter in states, symbols and all the relationships between the two. 

After the declarations of states, symbols and relationships are finished, the user can enter a string of characters that will be checked by the automaton. 

Finally, the automaton program will return if the string is accepted or not.
